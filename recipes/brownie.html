        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). 
                Lightly grease 24 muffin cups.</li>
            <li>Beat cocoa powder, 3/4 cup butter, oil, and 2 cups 
                sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until 
                smooth. Add eggs one at a time, allowing each egg 
                to blend into butter mixture before adding the 
                next. Beat in vanilla extract with last egg. Mix 
                flour mixture into egg mixture until just 
                incorporated. Fold in walnuts, mixing just enough 
                to evenly combine.</li>
            <li>Combine animal cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup sugar, and 
                6 tablespoons butter in a bowl; mix until well 
                blended. Press cracker mixture into the bottom of 
                each prepared muffin cup. Pour brownie mixture into 
                muffin cups, filling 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in
                 center comes out clean, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
